My research primarily focuses on **computer vision and machine learning for healthcare sector**, aiming to develop intelligent solutions to assist healthcare professionals in anatomical structure segmentation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy, particularly in the context of medical data analysis with limited annotations. I have published more than 50 peer-reviewed publications, most in flagship journals/conference proceedings including IEEE-TPAMI/TMI/TIP, IJCV, Medical Image Analysis, IEEE-TCSVT, MICCAI, CVPR, ECCV, IJCAI, ACCV.

Research Topics:
- Cutting-edge Technologies:
  -  Annotation-efficient deep learning & Self-/Semi-/Weak-supervised learning
  -  Multi-modal learning (2D/3D images/text/gene data) & Foundation model
  -  Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
  -  Image classification/segmentation/detection
- Medical Image Segmentation & Computer-Aided Diagnosis/Prognosis:
  -  Chest/Abdomen/Brain/Skin/Gland/Eye/Oral regions
  -  X-ray/CT/MRI/Dermoscopy/Pathology/Fundus/Report/Clinical/Gene data
