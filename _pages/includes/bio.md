# ðŸ˜Š About me

Yutong Xie is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Adelaide (UoA), and a member of the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), working with A/Prof. <a href="http://qi-wu.me/">Qi Wu</a>. She obtained her B.E. degree in 2016 and her Ph.D. in 2021 from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://jszy.nwpu.edu.cn/en/yongxia.html">Yong Xia</a>. She has also spent about two years at UoA during her PhD studies, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://cshen.github.io/">Chunhua Shen</a> and A/Prof. <a href="https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/johan.verjans">Johan Verjans</a>. 


My research primarily focuses on **computer vision and machine learning for healthcare sector**, aiming to develop intelligent solutions to assist healthcare professionals in anatomical structure segmentation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy, particularly in the context of medical data analysis with limited annotations. I have published more than 50 peer-reviewed publications, most in flagship journals/conference proceedings including IEEE-TPAMI/TMI/TIP, Medical Image Analysis, IEEE-TCSVT, MICCAI, CVPR, ECCV, IJCAI, ACCV.

Research Topics:
- Cutting-edge Technologies:
  -  Annotation-efficient deep learning & Self-/Semi-/Weak-supervised learning
  -  Multi-modal learning (2D/3D images/text/gene data) & Foundation model
  -  Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
  -  Image classification/segmentation/detection
- Medical Image Segmentation & Computer-Aided Diagnosis/Prognosis:
  -  Chest/Abdomen/Brain/Skin/Gland/Eye/Oral regions
  -  X-ray/CT/MRI/Dermoscopy/Pathology/Fundus/Report/Clinical/Gene data

**<span style="color: #c00000;">[Note]</span>**: **<span style="color: #850043;">I will join the Computer Vision Department at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a> as an assistant professor in January 2025. I am actively seeking highly motivated Postdocs, PhD students, Masterâ€™s students, and interns/visiting students to join my group after January 2025. If you are interested in working with me on the topics mentioned above, please feel free to contact me and refer to this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1txutJtrUrbcPUwztdut3d3HuAJ8q7iX3MK3rdRuVmFk/edit?usp=sharing) for further information.</span>**
