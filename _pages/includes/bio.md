My research primarily focuses on **computer vision and machine learning for healthcare sector**, aiming to develop intelligent solutions to assist healthcare professionals in anatomical structure segmentation, disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy, particularly in the context of medical data analysis with limited annotations. I have published more than 50 peer-reviewed publications, most in flagship journals/conference proceedings including IEEE-TPAMI/TMI/TIP, Medical Image Analysis, IEEE-TCSVT, MICCAI, CVPR, ECCV, IJCAI, ACCV.

Research Topics:
- Medical image classification/segmentation/detection 
- Medical visual-language learning
- Self-/Semi-/Weak-supervised learning
- Computed-aided diagnosis
  - Chest/Abdomen/Brain/Skin/Gland/Eye
  - X-ray/CT/MRI/Dermoscopy/Pathology/Fundus/Report/Clinical data
